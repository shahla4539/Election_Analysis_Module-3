# Election_Analysis_Module-3

# Overview of Election Audit
I am assisting **Tom**,Colorado Board of Election employee to **Audit** congressional election results. For this I will be using Python as Python can be very helpful to automate the process with simplfied codes. I am given task of reporting 
The total numbers of votes cast,
The total number of votes for each candidate,
The percentage of votes for each candidate and
The **Winner** of the Election based on the popular votes. 
After the completion of vote count my job is to generate a vote count report **Election Analysis** based on the final Election results. With successfully coding and creating an Election Analysis, Tom`s manager wants to utilize these codes not only for other congressinal district elections but also for sanatorial and local elections.
